RobotPy is a community of FIRST mentors and students dedicated to developing python-related projects for the FIRST Robotics Competition. The primary project we develop is a port of Python 3 and WPILib to the RoboRIO & cRio (obsolete) platforms, intended for use in FRC. Teams can use this to write their robot code in Python, a powerful dynamic programming language.
