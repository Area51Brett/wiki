## About the QDriverStation
The QDriverStation is a cross-platform and open-source alternative to the FRC Driver Station. It runs on multiple platforms, making it easier for FRC teams test their robot code and make public presentations with their robots.
## Supported Platforms
The QDriverStation runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. An [Android app](https://github.com/frc-utilities/qdriverstation-mobile/releases/tag/v16.08) is also available.
## QDriverStation vs. FRC DriverStation
### Why QDriverStation is better
The QDriverStation's greatest advantage is the large number of platforms it supports. While the FRC DriverStation only runs on Windows, the QDriverStation can run on many different operating systems (see above).
### Why FRC DriverStation is better
The FRC DriverStation is the only driver station currently allowed by the FTA during official competitions, and therefore must be used during official events instead of QDriverStation.
