{% include stub %}


A **limit switch** is a [digital](digital) [sensor](sensor). It has a value of
_open_ or _closed_, i.e., whether or not the switch lever has been hit to
depress the switch on the sensor. It can be wired as _normally open (NO)_ or
_normally closed (NC)_ to change how the values are interpreted.

On the [Robot Controller](robot-controller) a
closed switch gives a 0 while an open switch gives a 1.
