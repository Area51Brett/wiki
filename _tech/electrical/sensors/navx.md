navX MXP 2.0 combines a 9-axis sensor (3-axis [accelerometers](accelerometer), [gyroscopes](gyroscope) and magnetometers) with sophisticated data fusion, motion processing and sensor calibration algorithms.

Key specifications include:

* High-accuracy pose (yaw/pitch/roll), with minimal yaw drift of ~1 degree per minute
* Tilt-corrected absolute compass heading with magnetic disturbance detection
* 9-axis heading fusing pose and magnetically-valid compass heading data
