{% include wikilink topic="Pulse-width_modulation" %}

**PWM** stands for _**Pulse Width Modulation**_. A PWM signal is a square wave that transmits data by varying the width of the signal, or time which it is high, creating an [analog](analog) signal with limits, so to speak (any value between 0 and 1 inclusively). By varying the width of the signal, the [speed controller](speed-controller) can make changes to the speed the [motors](motor) are run at.
