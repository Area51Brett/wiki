A **digital** signal is a signal that is intended to be used in discrete
increments. It is different from an [analog](analog)
signal which does not have any discrete value assigned to it but has the
possibility of continuous values. In terms of [FIRST](first), and specifically the [Robot Controller](robot-controller), digital refers to a type of input where the interpreted value
is either _true_ or _false_ (1 or 0).
