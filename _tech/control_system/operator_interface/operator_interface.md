{% include historical %}

The **Operator Interface**, or **OI** was the name of the unit of the [control
system](control-system) that collects input controlled by the
human operator(s) and transmits it to the [Robot
Controller](robot-controller).

Prior to the 2010 season, this was a special control box. After that, a laptop
computer was used to communicate with the robot and it is now referred to as the
[Driver Station](driver-station).

In the past, the OI communicated with the RC using either a [radio
modem](radio-modem) or [tethered connection](tether). The OI inputs data from 4
ports. It also transmitted data out of the dashboard port.

The control system uses a team number identification system to ensure proper
communication during matches. In the past, teams set their team number into
the OI using DIP switches. As of 2010, team numbers are set via inputting the
number into the operator interface computer.

In general, the OI stays relatively the same from year to year. However,
typically the Robot Controller and Operator Interface of the same year must be
used together. To learn more about the different versions, see their
respective pages.
