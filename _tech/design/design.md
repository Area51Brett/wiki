There are several important portions of a robot that are commonly used each year. This section of the wiki has several common designs with comments on all of them. Some of these types of designs are:

* [Drive Trains](drive-train)
* [Intakes](intake)
* [Manipulators](manipulator)
* [Shooters](shooter)

There are many designs yet to be documents on this wiki. You can find some of these on some powerhouse team's resource pages such as these:

[Team 1114: Simbotics](http://www.simbotics.org/resources)

[Team 254: The Cheesy Poofs](https://www.team254.com/resources/)

[Team 610: Crescent Robotics](http://team610.com/frc-resources/)

On whatever page you get your information, it's useful to cite the original source as well.
