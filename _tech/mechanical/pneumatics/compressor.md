An **air compressor** is a [pneumatics](pneumatics)
component used to compress air for powering pneumatics systems.


## Connections

### Air

Air is output via a quick connector.


### Electrical Power

A voltage of +12v is necessary to run the compressor. Damage to the compressor
will result if the polarity is reversed. The compressor should be connected to
a [spike relay](spike-relay) to allow the robot controller to automatically
control the compressor with the help of a [pressure
switch](pressure-switch).
