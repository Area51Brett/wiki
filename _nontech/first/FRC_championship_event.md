The **FIRST World Championship** is the pinnacle of the [FIRST Robotics
Competition](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_Competition "FIRST Robotics
Competition" ), [FIRST Tech Challenge](ftc), and [FIRST Lego League](fll).
In FRC, teams from around the world compete in one large arena
in four different divisions. The location for the Championship has changed
over the years; it is currently held in St. Louis, Missouri.

## History

### 2011-2013 St. Louis, MO

On October 7th, 2009 _FIRST_ announced that the Americaâ€™s Center Convention
Complex in St. Louis would be the site of the 2011-2013 _FIRST_ Championships.

### 2004-2010 Atlanta, GA

The main event is held in the Georgia Dome, and the pits are located in the
adjacent Georgia World Congress Center. The team party has been held in
Centennial Olympic Park and inside the GWCC with fireworks, a hypnotist, and
inflatable games as entertainment, and of course, free food for all attending
team members.

### 2003 Houston, TX

[FIRST](first) outgrew Epcot Center, so the championship
had to move to Houston. While in one sense the Epcot Center was outgrown, the
primary reason for the move to Houston was bad timing -- Disney had something
planned for the date [FIRST](first) wanted, and the
conflict could not be resolved in a timely fashion. The fields were in Reliant
Stadium and the pits were in the adjacent Astrodome. The team party was held
at Six Flags AstroWorld across the street.

### 1995-2002 Orlando, FL

After 1994, the Championship was moved to
[Epcot](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot "wikipedia:Epcot" ) in [Disney
World](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_World "wikipedia:Disney_World" ). In
1995 and 1996, it was held in the American Pavilion (now the American Adventure
Theater). In 1997 and after, it was held in the parking lot of Epcot in tents.
There was one large tent for the pits and from 1997-1999, there were separate
tents for each field. From 2000 to 2002, the pit tent was extended, and all the
smaller fields were moved into that tent, while Einstein (the large field)
remained outdoors. However, Epcot told [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) that
it could not accommodate any more teams (their pit tent already was large enough
to hold 3 747's tail to nose), and so beginning in the 2002 season, a team had
to qualify to go to nationals. But despite all of that, Dean and Disney are
still good friends, with Disney sponsoring a few [FIRST](first) teams, and even
showing off, and renting, Segways in the parks.

### 1992-1994 Manchester, NH

Prior to 1995, the Championship was held in various high schools in southern
NH. In 1992, it was held in Memorial High School in Manchester, NH and in 1993
and 1994 it was held in Bishop Guertin High School in Nashua, NH.

## Qualification

Since 2001, teams have had to qualify to go to the national championship each
year. Qualification requirements may be different every year. Check [the FIRST
website](http://www.usfirst.org/ "http://www.usfirst.org/" ) for up-to-date
qualification information.

When the qualification system was first implemented, on alternating years even
or odd numbered teams would automatically qualify, and additional qualification
would be based on a points system, with varying points being assigned for
different awards. Since the beginning, the (national) [Chairman's
Award](frc-chairmans-award) winners were reserved a spot at the [national
championship](frc-championship-event). Since then, the system has changed to a
tier based structure, basing qualification more on how long a team has not been
to the nationals. There has been considerable controversy over the varying
methods, which go to the heart of FIRST's philosophy -- the issue being creating
a championship that is challenging and exciting to watch, while not focusing on
the competition aspect of the event as much as the rest of it.
