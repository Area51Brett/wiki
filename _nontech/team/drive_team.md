title: Drive Team

{% include stub %}

Recent FRC games allow 4 members of a team on the field to drive the robot
during a match. Three of the members must be "pre-college" students:

* 2 drivers/operators
* 1 [human player](human-players)

Additionally, a coach is allowed on the field, which may be a student or an 
adult.
