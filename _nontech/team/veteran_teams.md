{% include stub %}

Veteran teams are teams that have previously participated in a FRC game (i.e.
not [Rookie Teams](rookie-teams)). There's some question as to what constitutes
a veteran team versus a rookie team; some teams (i.e. [1727](/frc1000/1727))
started with rookie status, even though they had a veteran coach.
