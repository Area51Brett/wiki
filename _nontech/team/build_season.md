title: Build Season

{% include stub %}

In FIRST Robotics, the "build season" is the period of time between
[kickoff](kickoff) and when teams are no longer allowed to work on their robot.

In the past, teams had to ship their robot at the end of build season to their
Regional. In recent years, teams keep their robot at home and put it in a bag
instead.
