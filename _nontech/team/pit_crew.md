{% include stub %}

Often teams will assign a group of students or mentors to be the Pit Crew, and
they will be responsible to fix the robot if it gets damaged during the
competition.

At the FRC Championship event, only members of the [Drive Team](drive-team) and
valid members of the pit crew are allowed in the field-specific pits during the
elimination rounds.
