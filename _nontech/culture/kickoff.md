{% include stub %}

The kickoff is [FIRST](first)'s chance to reveal the season's new [FIRST
Robotics Competition](FRC) game. The actual kickoff is held in Manchester, NH at
a location near [FIRST headquarters](FIRST_headquarters "FIRST headquarters" ),
but remote kickoffs are held all around the country so team members can attend
local broadcasts and learn about the new game from the mouths of the people who
came up with it. FIRST celebrities like [Dean Kamen](dean-kamen) and [Woodie
Flowers](woodie-flowers) announce new features of the competition and stress the
importance of [gracious professionalism](gracious-professionalism). A
demonstration of the new game is also sometimes done, and a model of that year's
field is unveiled. Then, each team is given their kit of parts.
