**Spirit** is organized enthusiasm. 

Many teams have dedicated Spirit sub-teams. These teams provide a defined and
enthusiastic team image at competitions. Often this involves handing out
promotional items (such as buttons) to other teams, which help make a team
memorable when it comes time to pick alliance partners.
[Mascots](mascots), team costumes (including face paint
and dye), and banners are also involved with this area.
