The **FIRST subculture** is based largely on the idea of [gracious
professionalism](gracious-professionalism), extending from the more general [FIRST
philosophy](first-philosophy). FIRST is largely
made up into the culture by the people who occupy it.

The FIRST community is surprisingly tight knit for a group so widely spread
across the country. Part of what makes this unity are uniquely FIRST inside
jokes and other traditions. It is not uncommon for FIRSTers to meet via
[ChiefDelphi](chiefdelphi) or some other online
communication and then arrange meetings at Regionals or in non-FIRST related
activities.
