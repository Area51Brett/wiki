## Game Overview

FIRST Stronghold is based loosely on a Castle Raid. Each alliance much launch 10 in foam "Boulders" into the opponent alliance's "Tower" as well as traversing the alliance's "Defenses"

### Field

FIRST Stronghold is played on a standard [FRC field](frc-field), featuring "Scotch Pine" colored carpet. It features two main sections of the field, which is duplicated on each side of the field. The central area between the two Outer Works is the "neutral zone", in which 6 of the boulders start at the beginning of the match.

#### Outer Works

The outer works consists of 5 slots for various defenses on each side of the field. Each game round, the defenses will be switched out for various defenses chosen by that side of the field's alliance for the other alliance to traverse. The defense slots are numbered 1 through 5, with the secret passage bordering the 5th defense slot. Defense position 1 always had the "low bar", while defense position 3 was decided on by the audience.

Out of the 9 defenses, they were split up into five groups, lettered A-D and then the low bar. The following image shows the various groups:
